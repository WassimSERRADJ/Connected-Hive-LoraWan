# Connected-Hive-LoraWan-SODAQ-Explorer

Measure temperature and humidity with the DHT22 on the SODAQ Explorer then send to The thing Network and Cayenne via LoraWan then test data recovery on MySQL and Deep Sleep Mode.

Our project is to develop a connected hive. So we already done a function to get the temperatire, the humidity and the level of battery with LoraWan like you can see on the file "DHT22 with LoraWan". There is also the old file without LoraWan juste for the DHT22 on the SODAQ Explorer in the code "DHT22-SODAQ-Explorer". The file "Test DeepSleepMode" is all the code we test to run the deepsleep mode with SODAQ and LoraWan.
In this file you will find the test with the timer particulay. 

You can also find a report explaining the codes and all the work that has been done.
